In the first match between India and Sri Lanka, the Sri Lankan middle order faltered once again. After winning the toss, Sri Lanka opted to bowl first. India posted an imposing total of 213 runs, with Suryakumar Yadav scoring an impressive 58 runs off 26 balls.

Sri Lanka's innings began promisingly, with Pathum Nissanka scoring 79 runs off 48 balls and Kusal Mendis contributing 45 runs from 28 balls. However, the middle order collapsed rapidly, leading to the team's dismissal for just 170 runs.

For Sri Lanka to be competitive in the series, the middle order must step up and support the top-order batsmen by batting deep into the innings. The second match is scheduled to take place at Pallekele tomorrow (2024-07-28) at 7 pm Sri Lanka time. This is a must-win game for Sri Lanka to stay in the tournament.
