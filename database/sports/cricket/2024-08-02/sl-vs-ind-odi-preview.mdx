# Sri Lanka vs India ODI Series Preview and Squad Announcements
![SL-vs-IND-first-odi-match](/cricket/2024-08-01-sl-ind-1-odi.jpeg)

The three-match ODI series between Sri Lanka and India will be played on the 2nd, 4th, and 7th of August 2024 at R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo.

Sri Lanka lost the T20 series 3-0. Once again, the middle order crumbled, resulting in a loss in the third match's super over. India made four changes in the last dead rubber match, while Sri Lanka only replaced Dasun Shanaka with newcomer Chamindu Wickramasinghe.

Historically, Sri Lanka has not given much opportunity to bench players, even in inconsequential matches. This strategy often forces them to stick with the same batting lineup despite consistent failures. The Sri Lankan cricket selection committee needs to reconsider this approach to ensure backup players are ready when needed. Additionally, the players' inability to adapt to match situations is a significant concern that needs immediate attention. The top three batters performed well but failed to take the game deep. The challenging pitch conditions made it difficult for new batters to adjust.

The Sri Lanka ODI squad has been announced, but six main fast bowlers are injured. Consequently, new players have been added to the squad, along with three standby players, as a fever is affecting the team. Hopefully, the Sri Lankan team will be able to forget about the t20 series and play some good cricket in the ODI series.
