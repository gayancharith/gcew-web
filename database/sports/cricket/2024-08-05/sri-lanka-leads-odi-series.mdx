## Second ODI: A Solid Victory

The second ODI was just as thrilling! Avishka and Kusal Mendis got Sri Lanka off to a good start, even though Pathum Nissanka was out on his first ball. Dunith Wellalage and Kamindu Mendis played brilliant knocks towards the end, pushing Sri Lanka to a total of 240 runs.

India started strong with Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill, but the game took a turn when Pathum Nissanka made an incredible catch to dismiss Rohit. With that wicket, Jeffrey Vandersay, who stepped up as the replacement for the injured Wanindu Hasaranga, took top 6 wickets in quick succession! This really put India on the back foot. The Sri Lankan captain, Charith Asalanka, wrapped things up with another 3 wickets, ensuring a comfortable 32-run victory for Sri Lanka. It was a fantastic team effort from Sri Lanka, showing their skills in all departments to take down the world's number one team.
